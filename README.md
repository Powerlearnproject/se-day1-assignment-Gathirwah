Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems using structured and systematic methods.
Importance include:
  Scalability: Allows software to grow and adapt to increased demands.
  It makes it easier to update and maintain softwares.
  Drives the technologies of new innovations and solutions.
  Ensures that softwares are reliable and functioning correctly

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages.
          It enabled humans to communicate with computers more easily. Languages like C came up during this milestone.
  Establishment of software development as a discipline.
          It marked the recognition of software development as a formal engineering branch.  This was driven by the need to manage and maintain the increasing more complex 
          software systems.
  Rise of the agile methods.
          It marked a shift towards more flexible software development as they emphasized making softwares more suited to changing rapid needs of modern software projects.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements:  It includes gettting all the user requirements and system requirements tools ready.
   Design:  It involves creating a high level designs of the software architecture and user interface
   Implementation: It involves the writing of codes and building the software in accordance with the design recommendation.
   Testing: It involves doing various tests to check on the functionality of the software and ensure it meets the required standards.
   Deployment:  This now is the phase where the software is released to the customers.
   Maintenance:  It involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software to either maintain or improve its quality.
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall method is a linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving on to the next while the agile method has an iterative approach where Work is done in small cycles or "sprints," with frequent reassessment and adjustments based on feedback.
    The waterfall method is Predictable and easy to manage while the agile method is less predictable as it involves active user involvement.
    The waterfall method is well suited for well designed projects where less changes are expected e.g in infrastructure as it is a bit inflexible while the agile method is well suited for flexible projects that require frequent feedback like software development and product design.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
   A quality assurance enginner ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
   A project manager role is to oversee the planning,execution and ensure the delivery of any software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

 IDEs provides sites for writing, debugging and testing codes e.g visual studio code.
    VCS are used in tracking work to source code and coordinate work among team members e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Requirement changes might occur during any of the phases which might lead to delay in the delivery time.  Good planning and research can help in minimizing random 
     requiremnet changes.
     Tight deadlines which leads to extreme pressure to deliver a software and might lead to errors.  Breaking down a development process into several stages with given 
     strict timeline can assist in keeping the final deadline.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 Unit testing involves testing the individual modules of a software
   Integration testing tests the interaction between different subsystems.
   System testing now tests the entire software system as a whole.
   Acceptance testing tests the software to ensure it meets the required users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

 Prompt engineering is the structuring of well defined and clear queries to an artificial intelligence system to guide it in providing a more accurate response to your 
  liking.
  It is important as it helps in getting rid of unnecessarry information which is not needed at that time.  It also saves time as it directs an AI to provide the exact required  answer.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

  It is important as it helps in getting rid of unnecessarry information which is not needed at that time.  It also saves time as it directs an AI to provide the exact required  answer.
  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt.
     What is software development?

Improved prompt
  What is SDLC in software development.

  In the first prompt, the  AI might provide me with a lot of information about software development including the phases, the history and the current trends and even the development cycles while in the second prompt, the AI provides only the needed information about the software development life cycles.
